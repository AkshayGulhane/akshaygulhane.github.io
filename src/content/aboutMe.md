I’m _Akshay_ a <span>Full Stack Developer</span> with _"over 5 years"_ of Experience in building Web Applications!

I started my journey as a _"Software Engineer"_ in <span> January 2014 </span> with Tech Mahindra India Limited and then continued working with with couple of startups like _"Proxce"_, _"LearnApp"_, _"FriendlyForce"_, and _"Divercity"_. 
I have also done _"Master of Science in Computer Science"_ from the _"State University of New York at Binghamton"_, and worked with the _"Research Foundation for SUNY"_ as a _"Research Assistant"_.

I always want to _learn more_, _do more_, and _be more_. I’m also a firm believer that we should <span>never settle</span>!

I love _"and believe"_ the quote by _Steve Jobs_:

<quote>Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish!</quote>

I’m a _smart worker,_ _super curious,_ _passionate,_ _committed,_ _team player,_ and also a _fast learner_!
